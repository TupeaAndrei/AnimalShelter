        <p>It all started with a dream.</p>
        <p>Ever since we were younger, we loved animals very much and wanted to make a change and save the lives of stray animals.</p>
        <p>We grew up near cats and dogs <small>(and pigs, chickens etc :) )</small>, so we always had a bestfriend beside us. </p>
        <p>We just needed a partner in this adventure of saving animals so we got stronger together.</p>
        <p>This shelter is an ONG, we take money only from animal lovers (donations). </p>
        <p>We made our own website, our own media pages so people could find us and we could help one another.</p><br>

        <h4>November 2018</h4>
        <p>We were heading off college at 6 pm, it was dark and cold outside. We heard screams of help near the building.</p>
        <p>
            In a box we saw 3 small pups full of lice, fleas and Demodex, dehydrated and malnourished. Their fur has already fallen from their faces and their limbs. They are 1-1.5 months old and all girls. Of course they were scared. How could they be any
            other way when, they are so small in a world so huge and so evil?
        </p>
        <p>We took them to the vet, then at my house. I fed them and started to look for a forever home.</p>
        <p>Tupi and I found rescuers after one week. I loved these pups so much! We were very happy we have been able to take care of them and find them a good, loving family.</p> <br>
        <br>
        <p>This is how it all began.</p>
        <p>Of course we wanted to help more animals. The world is very unfair with these little ones... It breaks my heart to find everyday cats and dogs that are homeless, starving, cold, furless, injured... </p>
        <p>But with your help, we can make the world a better place for them! You can help us by donating, adopting or telling your friends to do so.</p>

        <h4>Let's talk about spay (female dog sterilization) and neuter (male dog sterilization)</h4>
        <section>
            <p>When you first bring home your new pet, one of the best ways to give them a healthy start is to spay or neuter them.</p>
            <p>Spaying or neutering will benefit your pet medically and behaviorally. Whether you are doing it for the greater good or for the good of your pet, spaying your female pet or neutering your male pet has many advantages. </p>
            <p>
                While you can have your pet spayed or neutered at almost any time, the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) recommends that you sterilize your cat by 5 months of age. This gives your cat the benefits of being spayed or neutered while
                still allowing your kitten time to grow.
            </p>
            <p>
                For dogs, the AAHA recommends that small-breed dogs which will weigh less than 45 pounds as an adult are spayed before they go into heat at 5 or 6 months, or neutered by 6 months. Large-breed dogs that will weigh over 45 pounds as adults should
                be neutered when they finish growing by around 9 to 15 months of age, and spayed between 5 to 15 months.
            </p>
            <p>Your vet can help you select the best time, which may depend on various factors.</p>
