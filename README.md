# Rescue Paws Project
## Web Application

On this website you will see the animal shelter Rescue Paws.
Here you can read about us, have an online tour into our shelter and donate if you want to help. You can visit the puppies and the kittens that are for adoption and fill an adoption formular. 
You can also bring an injured animal to us or your own pets to host them if you plan to go on vacation.


## Usage/Examples

```csharp
Whenever a stray animal is found, or brought by a civilian to the company it will be housed there, taken care of, added to a database to keep track of health , care etc.  And after "healing" they will be put up for adoption.
If a family has an animal, and they want/need to go in a vacation/business trip and they cannot take it with them, then the animal can be kept at our shelter for a set period of time until they come back.
```
